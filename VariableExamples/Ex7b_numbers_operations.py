print(14+3)  # addition
print(14-3)  # subtraction
print(14*3)  # multiplication
print()
print(0.123456789012345)
print(14/3)  # floating-point division (results in floating point answer)
print(14//3) # integer or floor division (truncates the floating point information)
print(14%3)  # modulo division (returns the integer remainder of a division operation)
print()

print(2**2) # exponentiation a**b is the same as a to the b power
print()

# basic order of operations
print( 5+5/2**2 )      # division happens before addition
print( (5+5)/2**2 )    # addition happens before division
